# VIPSTARCOIN URIs
Represents a VIPSTARCOIN payment URI. VIPSTARCOIN URI strings became the most popular way to share payment request, sometimes as a VIPSTARCOIN link and others using a QR code.

URI Examples:

```
vipstarcoin:VWTeUyCZsePENeFSMz7ydfY9HNevKiCChD
vipstarcoin:VWTeUyCZsePENeFSMz7ydfY9HNevKiCChD?amount=1.2
vipstarcoin:VWTeUyCZsePENeFSMz7ydfY9HNevKiCChD?amount=1.2&message=Payment&label=Satoshi&extra=other-param
```

## URI Validation
The main use that we expect you'll have for the `URI` class in VIPSTARCOINcore is validating and parsing VIPSTARCOIN URIs. A `URI` instance exposes the address as a VIPSTARCOINcore `Address` object and the amount in Satoshis, if present.

The code for validating URIs looks like this:

```javascript
var uriString = 'vipstarcoin:VWTeUyCZsePENeFSMz7ydfY9HNevKiCChD?amount=1.2';
var valid = URI.isValid(uriString);
var uri = new URI(uriString);
console.log(uri.address.network, uri.amount); // 'livenet', 120000000
```

## URI Parameters
All standard parameters can be found as members of the `URI` instance. However a VIPSTARCOIN URI may contain other non-standard parameters, all those can be found under the `extra` namespace.

## Create URI
Another important use case for the `URI` class is creating a VIPSTARCOIN URI for sharing a payment request. That can be accomplished by using a dictionary to create an instance of URI.

The code for creating an URI from an Object looks like this:

```javascript
var uriString = new URI({
  address: '12A1MyfXbW6RhdRAZEqofac5jCQQjwEPBu',
  amount : 10000, // in satoshis
  message: 'My payment request'
});
var uriString = uri.toString();
```
